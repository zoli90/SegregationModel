This is an implementation of Schelling's model of segregation that I wrote to study Java.

You can learn more about it on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schelling's_model_of_segregation) or by running the program.

SegregationModel+JNA.jar is a Windows 10 compatible version, while SegregationModel.jar is a Linux compatible version.

To run the program, run cmd and go to the directory where the jarfile is downloaded. Type:

```java -jar SegregationModel+JNA.jar```

The same command works for Linux terminal emulators as well.
